                <p>EquiPPE served as my final project for my bootcamp. The idea behind the project was to build an ecommerce site. I worked with a team of three other students. I was responsible for architecting the overall project design including managing the team respository and delegating initail responsibilities for each team member. I worked on the backend by creating and integrating the database using sequelize. I als took on the responsibility of defining the server side routes and controllers using Exoress. After an MVP was met I also went through and stylized the final product using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
